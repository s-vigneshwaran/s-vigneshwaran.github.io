                  In the recent years online social media platforms has been flooded with hateful remarks such as racism, sexism, homophobia etc. As a result, there have 
                  been many measures taken by various social media platforms to mitigate the spread of hate-speech over the internet. One particular concept within the domain 
                  of hate speech is instigating hate, which involves provoking hatred against a particular community, race, colour, gender, religion or ethnicity. In this 
                  work, we introduce \textit{ProvocationProbe} - a dataset designed to explore what distinguishes instigating hate speech from general hate speech. For this 
                  study, we collected around twenty thousand tweets from Twitter, encompassing a total of nine global controversies. These controversies span various themes 
                  including racism, politics, and religion. In this paper, i) we present an annotated dataset after comprehensive examination of all the controversies, ii) we also 
                  highlight the difference between hate speech and instigating hate speech by identifying distinguishing features, such as targeted identity attacks and reasons for hate.

                  Online social media has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ease of access and ability to connect with others. One of social 
                  media's main draws is its anonymity, allowing users to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This anonymity 
                  has also made social media prone to harmful content, which requires moderation to ensure responsible and productive use. Several methods using 
                  artificial intelligence have been employed to detect harmful content. However, conversation and contextual analysis of hate speech are still 
                  understudied. Most promising works only analyze a single text at a time rather than the conversation supporting it. In this work, we employ a 
                  tree-based approach to understand how users behave concerning toxicity in public conversation settings. To this end, we collect both the posts and 
                  the comment sections of the top 100 posts from 8 Reddit communities that allow profanity, totaling over 1 million responses. We find that toxic 
                  comments increase the likelihood of subsequent toxic comments being produced in online conversations. Our analysis also shows that immediate 
                  context plays a vital role in shaping a response rather than the original post. We also study the effect of consensual profanity and observe 
                  overlapping similarities with non-consensual profanity in terms of user behavior and patterns.

                  Rhymes and poems are a powerful medium for transmitting cultural norms and societal roles. 
                  However, the pervasive existence of gender stereotypes in these works perpetuates biased 
                  perceptions and limits the scope of individuals' identities. Past works have shown that 
                  stereotyping and prejudice emerge in early childhood, and developmental research on causal 
                  mechanisms is critical for understanding and controlling stereotyping and prejudice. 
                  This work contributes by gathering a dataset of rhymes and poems to identify gender 
                  stereotypes. We then propose a model with 97\% accuracy to address gender bias. Gender 
                  stereotypes were rectified using a Large Language Model (LLM) and human educators along 
                  with a survey comparing their effectiveness. The findings highlight the pervasive nature of 
                  gender stereotypes in literary works and reveal the potential of LLMs in rectifying gender 
                  stereotypes and encourage further research in this area. This study raises awareness and 
                  promotes inclusivity within artistic expressions, making a significant contribution to the 
                  discourse on gender equality.

                  In spite of years of research, the mechanisms that underlie the development of 
                  schizophrenia, as well as its relapse, symptomatology, and treatment, continue to be a 
                  mystery. The absence of appropriate analytic tools to deal with the variable and 
                  complicated nature of schizophrenia may be one of the factors that contribute to the 
                  development of this disorder. Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence 
                  that was inspired by the nervous system. In recent years, deep learning has made it 
                  easier to model and analyse complicated, high-dimensional, and nonlinear systems. 
                  Research on schizophrenia is one of the many areas of study that has been revolutionised 
                  as a result of the outstanding accuracy that deep learning algorithms have demonstrated 
                  in classification and prediction tasks. Deep learning has the potential to become a 
                  powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms that are at the root of schizophrenia. 
                  In addition, a growing variety of techniques aimed at improving model interpretability 
                  and causal reasoning are contributing to this trend. Using multi-site fMRI data and a 
                  variety of deep learning approaches, this study seeks to identify different types of 
                  schizophrenia. Our proposed method of temporal aggregation of the 4D fMRI data 
                  outperforms existing work. In addition, this study aims to shed light on the strength of
