              I am a research intern in Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=GKegbo0AAAAJ">Rajesh Sharma</a>‘s 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://css.cs.ut.ee/">Computational Social Science Group</a>. My work is located at 
              the intersection of NLP and social science. Right now, I am particularly interested in 
              solving problems in hate and abuse speech on online social media platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm currently looking for PhD position in and around the topic of hate speech. You can find my research proposal outlining my 
              objectives and interests <a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/PhD Proposal_Vigneshwaran Shankaran.pdf">here</a>. The crux: I'm interested in enhancing
              hate speech detection and mitigation using NLP. I'm particularly interested in contextual analysis.

              In May 2022, I completed my Masters in Data Science and Computing at SSSIHL, India, where I was supervised by Prof. Bhaskaran V. 
              In my master thesis, I worked on diagnosing Schizophrenia from fMRI scans using CNN, in which I proposed a novel temporal 
              aggregation method. However, my current interest does not involve computer-aided diagnosis.

                  Online social media has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ease of access and ability to connect with others. One of social 
                  media's main draws is its anonymity, allowing users to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or retribution. This anonymity 
                  has also made social media prone to harmful content, which requires moderation to ensure responsible and productive use. Several methods using 
                  artificial intelligence have been employed to detect harmful content. However, conversation and contextual analysis of hate speech are still 
                  understudied. Most promising works only analyze a single text at a time rather than the conversation supporting it. In this work, we employ a 
                  tree-based approach to understand how users behave concerning toxicity in public conversation settings. To this end, we collect both the posts and 
                  the comment sections of the top 100 posts from 8 Reddit communities that allow profanity, totaling over 1 million responses. We find that toxic 
                  comments increase the likelihood of subsequent toxic comments being produced in online conversations. Our analysis also shows that immediate 
                  context plays a vital role in shaping a response rather than the original post. We also study the effect of consensual profanity and observe 
                  overlapping similarities with non-consensual profanity in terms of user behavior and patterns.

                  We demonstrate the Misinformation Concierge, a powerful tool that provides actionable intelligence on misinformation 
                  prevalent in social media. Specifically, it uses language processing and machine learning tools to identify 
                  subtopics of discourse and discerns non/misleading posts; presents statistical reports for policy-makers to understand 
                  the big picture of prevalent misinformation in a timely manner; and recommends rebuttal messages for specific pieces 
                  of misinformation, identified from within the corpus of data - providing means to intervene and counter 
                  misinformation promptly. The Misinformation Concierge proof-of-concept using a curated dataset is accessible at:

                  In spite of years of research, the mechanisms that underlie the development of 
                  schizophrenia, as well as its relapse, symptomatology, and treatment, continue to be a 
                  mystery. The absence of appropriate analytic tools to deal with the variable and 
                  complicated nature of schizophrenia may be one of the factors that contribute to the 
                  development of this disorder. Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence 
                  that was inspired by the nervous system. In recent years, deep learning has made it 
                  easier to model and analyse complicated, high-dimensional, and nonlinear systems. 
                  Research on schizophrenia is one of the many areas of study that has been revolutionised 
                  as a result of the outstanding accuracy that deep learning algorithms have demonstrated 
                  in classification and prediction tasks. Deep learning has the potential to become a 
                  powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms that are at the root of schizophrenia. 
                  In addition, a growing variety of techniques aimed at improving model interpretability 
                  and causal reasoning are contributing to this trend. Using multi-site fMRI data and a 
                  variety of deep learning approaches, this study seeks to identify different types of 
                  schizophrenia. Our proposed method of temporal aggregation of the 4D fMRI data 
                  outperforms existing work. In addition, this study aims to shed light on the strength of 
                  connections between various brain areas in schizophrenia individuals.
